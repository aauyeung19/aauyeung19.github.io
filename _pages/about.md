Hello! I am Andrew, a data scientist seeking employment in the New York Metropolitan area.  I am a recent Data Science bootcamp grad from [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.thisismetis.com/). I enjoy long walks on the beach, early morning bike rides, and NLP analysis. Before pivoting my career, I was a High School AP Physics teacher for four years at Fair Lawn High School using student grades and feedback to inform daily decisions. I am interested in continuing to let data lead my decisions by applying natural langauge processing and machine learning to get new types of data for me to analyze.
