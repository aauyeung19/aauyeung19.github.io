Hello! I am Andrew, a data scientist seeking employment in the New York Metropolitan area.  I recently graduated from [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/), an ACCET accredited 12 week immersive data science bootcamp focused on project oriented learning. I enjoy long walks on the beach, early morning bike rides, and NLP analysis. Before pivoting my career, I was a High School AP Physics teacher for four years at Fair Lawn High School using student grades and feedback to inform daily decisions. I am interested in continuing to let data lead my decisions by applying natural langauge processing and machine learning to get new types of data for me to analyze.
